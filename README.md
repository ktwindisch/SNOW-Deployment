<h1>ServiceNow Deployment for Strawberry Inc.</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

As the acting system administrator, I undertook a comprehensive ServiceNow deployment capstone project that encompassed six distinct task categories. Each category was meticulously configured to enhance operational efficiency and streamline IT service management for the organization.

<h2>Key Highlights:</h2>

<h3>Incident Management Configuration:</h3> I established a robust incident management system that supported the new process for troubleshooting technical issues that users experiences with the "Strawberry sFone" product. This incident form enables swift identification, tracking, and resolution of issues. This configuration facilitated improved incident reporting, escalation, and resolution times.

Task Assignment and Communication: I configured task assignment and communication channels, ensuring seamless collaboration within the organization. This enhanced workflow management, team coordination, and response times to service requests.

Scheduled Reports: I implemented scheduled reports for monitoring and analyzing system performance and service delivery metrics. These reports provided valuable insights for informed decision-making and continuous improvement.
