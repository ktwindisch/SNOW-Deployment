<h1>ServiceNow Deployment for Strawberry Inc.</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

As the acting ServiceNow System Administrator, I undertook a comprehensive deployment project that encompassed six distinct task categories. Each category was meticulously configured to enhance operational efficiency and streamline IT service management for the organization.

This ServiceNow deployment project significantly enhanced IT service management, user experience, and operational efficiency for Strawberry Inc., ultimately contributing to the organization's success and effectiveness.

<h2>Key Highlights:</h2>

<h3>Incident Management Configuration:</h3> I established a robust incident management system that supported the new process for troubleshooting technical issues that users experiences with the "Strawberry sFone" product. This incident form enables swift identification, tracking, and resolution of issues. This configuration facilitated improved incident reporting, escalation, and resolution times.

<h3>Service Catalog Item Fulfillment Automation:</h3> By automating service catalog item fulfillment, I optimized the request-to-fulfillment process. By developing a flow to help support this process, users can seamlessly request services, and automation ensures rapid and error-free service delivery.
