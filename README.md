<h1>ServiceNow Deployment for Strawberry Inc.</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

As the acting system administrator, I undertook a comprehensive ServiceNow deployment capstone project that encompassed six distinct task categories. Each category was meticulously configured to enhance operational efficiency and streamline IT service management for the organization.

<h2>Key Highlights:</h2>

<h3>Incident Management Configuration:</h3> I established a robust incident management system that supported the new process for troubleshooting technical issues that users experiences with the "Strawberry sFone" product. This incident form enables swift identification, tracking, and resolution of issues. This configuration facilitated improved incident reporting, escalation, and resolution times.

<h3>Service Catalog Item Fulfillment Automation:</h3> By automating service catalog item fulfillment, I optimized the request-to-fulfillment process. By developing a flow to help support this process, users can seamlessly request services, and automation ensures rapid and error-free service delivery.

<h3>Knowledge Base Management:</h3> A comprehensive knowledge base was developed and managed, facilitating self-service for users and reducing the burden on support teams. It served as a valuable resource for troubleshooting and information dissemination. We also applied company security protocols that ensured the right information was accessible only by those who needed it.
